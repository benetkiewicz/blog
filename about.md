My name is Piotr Benetkiewicz and I am .net developer with 9 years of experience. In this blog I share all kinds of stuff about .net and programming in general, that is inspired by my everyday work.
Feel free to contact me via email [pbenetkiewicz@gmail.com](mailto:pbenetkiewicz@gmail.com), see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrbenetkiewicz) or see my [second blog](http://devproductivity.wordpress.com) about, well, dev productivity.
