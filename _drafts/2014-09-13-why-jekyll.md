Why I started a blog based on Jekyll and hosted on Github?

* Github pages are really cool, I love git and here you deploy with a push!
* Opportunity to learn a bit about Ruby and Python
* Wordpress seems too regular-user-ish. With Jekyll I have programming without programming ;)
* I want to master markdown syntax

{% highlight c# %}
public static void main()
{
}
{% endhighlight %}
