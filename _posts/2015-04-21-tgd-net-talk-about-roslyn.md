I am a proud member of [TGD.NET][tgdnet] (local group of .NET developers and students) and today I gave a [talk about .NET compiler platform][event] (codename Roslyn). It was great to be back on stage :)
You can find my slides here on [slideshare][slides] and the demo code is hosted on [github][code].
