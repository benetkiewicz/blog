And here I am, starting yet another blog. In my first project, [DevProductivity Blog](http://devproductivity.wordpress.com), I tried hard not to get into programming topics. However, I am a programmer, I code for a living and almost every day brings interesting things to share to the world. Hopefully I will find strong will to update both blogs.
